{{short description|Wikipedia glossary}}
This '''glossary of astronomy''' is a list of definitions of terms and concepts relevant to [[astronomy]] and [[cosmology]], their sub-disciplines, and related fields. Astronomy is concerned with the study of [[astronomical object|celestial objects]] and [[celestial event|phenomena]] that originate outside the [[atmosphere of Earth]]. The field of astronomy features an extensive vocabulary and a significant amount of jargon.

{{term|[[accretion disk]]}}
{{defn|A roughly circular mass of diffuse material in {{gli|orbit}} around a central object, such as a {{gli|star}} or {{gli|black hole}}. The material is acquired from a source external to the central object, and friction causes it to spiral inward towards the object.}}

{{term|[[albedo]]}}
{{defn|A measure of the proportion of the total [[solar radiation]] received by an {{gli|astronomical body}}, such as a {{gli|planet}}, that is [[diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] away from the body. It is a dimensionless quantity typically measured on a scale from 0 (indicating total absorption of all incident radiation, as by a {{gli|black body}}) to 1 (indicating total reflection). The albedo reported for an astronomical body may vary widely by the spectral and angular distribution of the incident radiation, by the "layer" of the body being measured (e.g. upper atmosphere versus surface), and by local variation within these layers (e.g. [[cloud cover]] and geological or environmental surface features).}}

{{defn|The time it takes for an object to rotate once about its own {{gli|axis of rotation|axis}} (e.g. its {{gli|rotation period}}) relative to the {{gli|primary}} it is orbiting (rather than to distant {{gli|fixed stars}}).
