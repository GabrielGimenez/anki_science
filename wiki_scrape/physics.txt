It is a [[two-port network|two-port]] electronic circuit that uses electric power from a [[power supply]] to increase the [[amplitude]] of a signal applied to its input terminals, producing a proportionally greater amplitude signal at its output.  The amount of amplification provided by an amplifier is measured by its [[gain (electronics)|gain]]: the ratio of output voltage, current, or power to input.  An amplifier is a circuit that has a [[power gain]] greater than one.<ref name="Crecraft">{{cite book| last1  = Crecraft| first1 = David| last2  = Gorham| first2 = David| title  = Electronics, 2nd Ed.| publisher = CRC Press| date   = 2003| location = | pages  = 168| language = | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=Yq66DDW4f8IC&pg=PA168&dq=amplifier+power| doi    = | id     = | isbn   = 978-0748770366}}</ref><ref name="Agarwal">{{cite book | last1  = Agarwal| first1 = Anant  | last2  = Lang  | first2 = Jeffrey | title  = Foundations of Analog and Digital Electronic Circuits| publisher = Morgan Kaufmann| date   = 2005| location = | pages  = 331| language = | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=lGgP7FDEv3AC&pg=PA331&dq=amplifier+power| doi    = | id     = | isbn   = 978-0080506814}}</ref><ref name="Glisson">{{cite book | last1  = Glisson | first1 = Tildon H. | title  = Introduction to Circuit Analysis and Design | publisher = Springer Science and Business Media | date   = 2011 | location = | language = | url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=7nNjaH9B0_0C&pg=PA197&dq=amplifier+power | doi    = | id  = | isbn   = 978-9048194438}}</ref>}}

{{term|[[amplitude]]}}
{{defn|The height of a {{gli|wave}} measured from its center (normal) position.}}

{{term|[[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]]}}
{{defn|defn=In [[geometric optics]], the '''angle of incidence''' is the angle between a [[incident ray|ray incident]] on a surface and the line perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence, called the [[surface normal|normal]].  The ray can be formed by any wave: [[light wave|optical]], [[sound wave|acoustic]], [[microwave]], [[X-ray]], etc.}}

{{term|[[angle of reflection]]}}
{{defn|defn=Reflection is the change in direction of a [[wavefront]] at an [[wikt:interface|interface]] between two different [[medium (optics)|media]] so that the wavefront returns into the medium from which it originated. Common examples include the reflection of [[light]], [[sound]] and [[water wave]]s. The ''law of reflection'' says that for [[specular reflection]] the angle at which the wave is incident on the surface equals the angle at which it is reflected. [[Mirror]]s exhibit specular reflection.}}

{{term|[[angular acceleration]]}}
{{defn|defn=Is the time rate of change of [[angular velocity]]. In three dimensions, it is a [[pseudovector]]. In [[SI]] units, it is measured in [[radians]] per [[second]] squared (rad/s{{sup|2}}), and is usually denoted by the Greek letter [[alpha (letter)|alpha]] ([[α]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/physics/circ/node3.html |title=Angular Velocity and Acceleration |publisher=Theory.uwinnipeg.ca |accessdate=2015-04-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222015414/http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/physics/circ/node3.html |archive-date=2012-02-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>. Just like angular velocity, there are two types of angular acceleration: spin angular acceleration and orbital angular acceleration, representing the time rate of change of spin angular velocity and orbital angular velocity respectively. Unlike linear acceleration, angular acceleration need not be caused by a net external [[torque]]. For example, a figure skater can speed up her rotation (thereby obtaining an angular acceleration) simply by contracting her arms inwards, which involves no ''external'' torque.}}
{{term|[[angular displacement]]}}
{{defn|defn=Angular displacement of a body is the [[angle]] in [[radian]]s ([[degree (angle)|degree]]s, [[turn (geometry)|revolutions]]) through which a point revolves around a centre or line has been rotated in a specified sense about a specified [[rotation|axis]].}} 
{{term|[[angular frequency]]}}
{{defn|defn=Angular frequency ''ω'' (also referred to by the terms angular speed, radial frequency, circular frequency, orbital frequency, radian frequency, and pulsatance) is a scalar measure of rotation rate. It refers to the [[angular displacement]] per unit time (e.g., in rotation) or the rate of change of the phase of a sinusoidal waveform (e.g., in oscillations and waves), or as the rate of change of the argument of the sine function.

Angular frequency (or angular speed) is the magnitude of the vector quantity ''[[angular velocity]]''. The term '''angular frequency vector''' <math>\vec{\omega}</math> is sometimes used as a synonym for the vector quantity angular velocity.<ref name="UP1">{{cite book

{{term|[[angular momentum]]}}
{{defn|defn=(Rarely, moment of momentum or rotational momentum) is the rotational equivalent of [[linear momentum]]. It is an important quantity in physics because it is a [[Conservation law|conserved quantity]]—the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant.}}
{{term|[[angular velocity]]}}
{{defn|defn=Refers to how fast an object rotates or revolves relative to another point, i.e. how fast the angular position or orientation of an object changes with time. There are two types of angular velocity: orbital angular velocity and spin angular velocity. Spin angular velocity refers to how fast a rigid body rotates with respect to its centre of rotation. Orbital angular velocity refers to how fast a rigid body's centre of rotation revolves about a fixed origin, i.e. the time rate of change of its angular position relative to the origin. In general, angular velocity is measured in angle per unit time, e.g. [[radians per second]]. The  [[SI]] unit of angular velocity is expressed as radians/sec with the radian having a dimensionless value of unity, thus the SI units of angular velocity are listed as ''1/sec''. Angular velocity is usually represented by the symbol [[omega]] (ω, sometimes Ω). By convention, positive angular velocity indicates counter-clockwise rotation, while negative is clockwise.}}

{{defn|The electrode through which a conventional {{gli|current|electric current}} flows into a polarized electrical device; the direction of current flow is, by convention, opposite to the direction of {{gli|electron}} flow, and so electrons flow ''out of'' the anode. In a [[galvanic cell]], the anode is the negative terminal or pole which emits electrons toward the external part of an {{gli|electrical circuit}}.

{{term|[[antiparticle]]}}
{{defn|defn=In [[particle physics]], every type of [[particle]] has an associated antiparticle with the same [[mass]] but with opposite [[charge (physics)|physical charges]] (such as [[electric charge]]). For example, the antiparticle of the [[electron]] is the [[antielectron]] (which is often referred to as ''positron''). While the electron has a negative electric charge, the positron has a positive electric charge, and is produced naturally in certain types of [[radioactive decay]].  The opposite is also true: the antiparticle of the positron is the electron.  Some particles, such as the [[photon]], are their own antiparticle. Otherwise, for each pair of antiparticle partners, one is designated as normal matter (the kind all matter usually interacted with is made of), and the other (usually given the prefix "anti-") as ''[[antimatter]]''.}}
