Briefly describe the Kraft break	A: The abrupt decrease in stars' rotation rates at surface temperatures of about 6200 K. The dynamos are thought to maintain magnetic fields that transfer angular momentum to the stellar wind, thus slowing down the star's surface through magnetic braking.

Briefly describe the Rayleigh criterion	A: theta = 1.22 lambda/D, for lambda the wavelength, D the lens aperture, and theta the angular resolution. Points separated below this theta are not resolvable. For an array (interferometer), it is lambda/B, for B the largest baseline.
Briefly describe the Roche limit	A: The distance within which a celestial body, held together only by its own force of gravity, will disintegrate due to a second celestial body's tidal forces exceeding the first body's gravitational self-attraction. Inside the Roche limit, orbiting material disperses and forms rings whereas outside the limit material tends to coalesce.

When you use high orders, you get better spectral resolution, but orders overlap, so you need a cross-disperser (a second grating or prism). Most modern spectrographs are echelles (e.g. Keck/HIRES, HARPS).
Briefly describe the following instrument and its purpose: grazing-incidence mirror	A: Have rings of hyperbolic mirrors which focus incoming X-rays to a point. Use because glass lenses are opaque to X-ray light: they absorb it rather than refracting it.

Briefly explain the following problems. Are they still problems? How resolved? Core/cusp problem	A: N-body simulations predict dark matter distributions with cusps (high density at small radii). However, observations suggest flatter DM density profiles (cores). Unsolved, but solutions include: feedback from AGNs - time varying potential transfers energy to CDM. Warm, fuzzy, and self-interacting DM can also produce cores.
Briefly explain the following problems. Are they still problems? How resolved? Cosmological constant problem	A: Predicted cosmological constant from QFT is (vacuum energy) 120 orders of magnitude larger than that observed. Unresolved.

Some recent work has argued you can let the vacuum energy gravitate which predicts small H rather than infinite.
Briefly explain the following problems. Are they still problems? How resolved? Final parsec problem	A: Dynamical friction brings SMBHs together during collision.

Briefly explain the following problems. Are they still problems? How resolved? Flatness problem	A: The density in the universe is almost exactly equal to the critical density, implying a flat universe. For this to be the case, any discrepancy would have to be of order 10^-60 in the early universe. If the initial curvature could take any value, why is it identically 0? You can measure it by looking at the angular fluctuations in the CMB and comparing it to flat/open models. Still a problem, but inflation solves both it and the horizon problem: let a~e^lambda t in the early universe due to some constant density inflaton field, which brings flatness back to 0.
Briefly explain the following problems. Are they still problems? How resolved? GRB distance controversy	A: GRBs are very high energy and short burts. Since an extragalactic origin would require them to be extremely energetic in a small emission region, it was thought unlikely. However: isotropic distribution from BATSE, and recently the GW and optical counterparts for a GRB have entirely ruled out MW sources.
Briefly explain the following problems. Are they still problems? How resolved? Horizon problem	A: CMB is homogeneous yet only patches within 2 -degrees could have been in causal contact. Solved by inflation.

Solutions include calibration of SN might not be getting metallicity right.
Briefly explain the following problems. Are they still problems? How resolved? Lithium problem	A: Discrepancy between the observed abundance of lithium produced in BBN and the amount that should theoretically exist. Most accepted models of the Big Bang have three times as much primordial lithium (lithium-7) should exist. Despite correct predictions for H/He. Unsolved. Potential solutions look at different BBN reaction flow: faster destruction of Li7. 
Briefly explain the following problems. Are they still problems? How resolved? Meter barrier	A: In a protoplanetary disk with gas, small dust particles are coupled to the gas pressure, while large planetesimals (km size) ignore the gas. But particles with ~ 1m size experience strong gas drag and should spiral into the star with very short timescales, so how do we build up planets? Possible solution – streaming instability (Youdin & Goodman 2005), where dust particles form a stream (think birds flying in formation) that builds up mass and eventually coalesce quickly, bypassing the meter barrier.
Briefly explain the following problems. Are they still problems? How resolved? Missing satellites problem	A: The number of dwarf galaxies (satellites) observed is orders of magnitude lower than expected from simulation (11 vs 500 for MW) - even though normal galaxies match. Unsolved. Solutions: ultra-faint dwarfs so unobserved - tidally stripped. Adding baryons can decrease magnitude of galaxies. 
Briefly explain the following problems. Are they still problems? How resolved? Olbers’ paradox	A: Like an infinite forest, a static/isotropic universe should have a star in any line of sight and be bright. Solved by expanding universe and redshift, which shifts dominant light out of the visible band. Light ends in CMB.
Briefly explain the following problems. Are they still problems? How resolved? Solar abundance problem	A: The latest data for standard solar composition fed into the stellar interior models leads to conflicts with measurements from helioseismology. This is an unsolved problem. Future solutions include non standard interior models, accreted metal-poor material, gravitational settling, better radiative opacities.
Briefly explain the following problems. Are they still problems? How resolved? Solar neutrino problem	A: 1/3 as many neutrinos coming from the sun as predicted. The answer: neutrino oscillations
Briefly explain the following problems. Are they still problems? How resolved? Winding problem for spiral galaxies	A: Galaxies are observed to have differential rotation, meaning that physical spiral structures would wind up over time and become impossible to differentiate from the rest. This is a solved problem via density wave theory. The solution is that the spirals are not physical but overdensities: quasistatic spiral structures, which do rotate as rigid bodies. The gravitational attraction of stars passing through the spiral region pull on other stars in such a way that the structures are maintained. The spiral density waves can help form shocks and is important for star formation.

What is this acronym? SMBH	A: Supermassive black hole
What is this acronym? SNR	A: Signal-to-noise ratio
What is this acronym? SPH	A: Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (=meshfree). Numerical methods for continuum media. Allow the coordinates to move with the fluid and the resolution be variable.
What is this acronym? UHECR	A: Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray. Cosmic ray with greater than 1e18 eV energy. Rare. Thought to be caused by makeshift particle accelerators via AGN/shocks. 
What is this acronym? WIMP	A: Weakly-interacting massive particle. One model proposed for dark matter particles. 
What is this acronym? WMAP	A: Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. 20-90GHz precision measurement of the CMB's temperature fluctuations, producing a 1% measurement of the age of the universe. 
What is this acronym? ΛCDM	A: Lambda cold dark matter, the Lambda stands for dark energy.
Why is the sky blue? Why is the sunset red?	A: The sky is blue due to Rayleigh scattering. The sunset is red for the same reason.
