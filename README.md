# Anki Science

A collection of Anki decks for advanced science topics. Some have been hand-written, and some have been scraped from Wikipedia. Currently these scrapes are simply (term, summary) question-answer pairs for every term in each subject's Wikipedia glossary.

## Tips:

For the Wikipedia scrapes: 
- Don't memorize these word for word. Use the Anki decks as guides to learn terms you don't understand, but if it's new, try not to just rely on the card. Have a sense of intuition for the term before you click "good" or "easy."
- At the same time, don't be intimidated by the long definitions. These are there to remind you of the term, but you should not require yourself to have that level of an explanation. If you feel like you understand the concept, move on.

For the others:
- It varies by deck, and how you use the Anki deck is up to you. Some decks are simply equations - do you want to have an intuition for each equation, understand the scaling, or memorize every term in each equation? It's up to you.
- For all of them, make sure you actually understand a concept before clicking "good." Don't simply memorize words in the card.

General:
- While using another person's or auto-generated deck is a time saver, condensing and writing the answers yourself will probably help you learn in a different way. See http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html (thanks @ulisrael1 for showing me this article!)
- Don't try to learn it all at once. Set a small number of new cards a day (since you will be spending time reviewing others), and gradually increase it if you would like.
